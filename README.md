# Discord Stream Schedule

This is basically for my discord server, but i'll open source it. Feel free to use it!

This is a place where you can type your stream schedule faster without converting each time and dates into unix-timestamp (epoch). Just insert date, time and title of the stream, then copy the output and paste into your discord announcements!
